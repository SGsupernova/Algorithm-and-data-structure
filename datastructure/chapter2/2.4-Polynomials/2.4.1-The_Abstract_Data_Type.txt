The ordered or linear list.

The most common implementation is to represent an ordered list as an array where we associate the
list element, itemᵢ, with the array index i. We call this a sequential mapping because,
	 assuming the standard implementation of an array, we are storing itemᵢ, itemᵢ₊₁ into
	 consecutive slots i and i+1 of the array.

Let us jump right into a problem requiring ordered lists, which we will solve by using
one-dimensional arrays. This problem has become the classical example for motivating the use of list
processing techniques, which we will see in later chapters.
Viewd from a mathematical perspective, a polynomail is a sum of terms, where each term has a form
axⁿ, where x is the variable, a is the coefficient, and n is the exponent. Two example
polynomails are: 
	A(x) = 3x²⁰+ 4 and B(x) = x⁴ + 3x² + 1
The largest (or leading) exponent of a polynomal is called its degree.
