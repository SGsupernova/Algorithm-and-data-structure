# Fundamentals of Data Structures in C (2nd Edition) : Horowitz, Sahni, anderson-freed
The summary and addtion of book
This repository summarizes "Fundamentals of Data Structures in c" just for me. This content of the summary can be loosely connected. So I recommend that you read this book.

## Preface
**Why Fundamentals of Data Structures in c ?**<br />
1. C has become the main development language both on PC as well as on UNIX-based workstations<br/>
2. The quality of C compilers and C programming development environments has improved to the point where it makes sense to provide instruction to beginners in a C environment.<br/>
3. Many of the concepts that need to be taught in the programming systems areas of computer science, such as virtual memory, file systems, automatic parser generators, lexical analyzers, networking, etc, are implemented in C. Thus, instructions are now teaching students C early in their academic life so that these concepts can be fully explored later on.
