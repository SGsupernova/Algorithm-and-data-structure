# Algorithm-Homework-and-Project

# First homework - Quick Sort
the propose is the realizing the quick sort in many ways

 1. Iteraive method
 2. Recursive method
 3. Hybrid method(Insertion sort + Iteraive quick sort)
 4. Hybrid method(Insertion sort + Recursive quick sort)

Using insertion sort when the number of elements is less than particular number, Hybrid method reduces the function calls that uses system stack.

# Second homework - dynamic programming
 1. Least Common Subsequence (LCS)
 2. Edit Distance
 3. Balanced Partition
